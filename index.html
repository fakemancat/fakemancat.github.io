                            Building Interactive Lists with the new Angular 7 Drag and Drop tool
                    </span>

                            Angular is JavaScript (TypeScript) framework for building web applications, mobile or desktop with over 42,000 ‚≠êÔ∏è on GitHub. It is maintained by the Angular Team at Google and a host of community members and organizations. Angular Version 7 was released few weeks ago. One of the features it shipped with is the Drag and Drop tool in the Component Development Kit.
                            <br><br>
                            The Component Development Kit is a set of tools that implement common behaviors and components with very unique interaction styles without being opinionated about the template choices. It is a kind of abstraction of the Angular Material Library, with no styling specific to material design. It provides more unique ways to get creative while building your angular components.

                        Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs

                            Learning modern JavaScript is tough if you haven‚Äôt been there since the beginning. The ecosystem is growing and changing so rapidly that it‚Äôs hard to understand the problems that different tools are trying to solve. I started programming in 1998 but only began to learn JavaScript seriously in 2014. At the time I remember coming across Browserify and staring at its tagline:
                            <br><br>
                            I pretty much didn‚Äôt understand any word in this sentence, and struggled to make sense of how this would be helpful for me as a developer.
